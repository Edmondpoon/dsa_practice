# Heap
Implementation of a max heap and a min heap in multiple languages.

# Compilation

## C
- `make` or `make all` will compile all C source files into the executable `client`, which can be used for a min heap and a max heap.
- `make clean` will clean/remove all created object files and the final executables.

## Python
- `python heap.py` or `python3 heap.py` will run the main function with a min or max heap present in the given file.
